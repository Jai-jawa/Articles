# Color in UI Design: A (Practical) Framework


According to the article 'Color in UI Design: A (Practical) Framework' written by Erik D Kennedy, when trying to decide the color scheme for a website, a better alternative to 'split color complimentry' technique is to use shades of the same colors, he calls it the 'color modification' technique, which according to him is more initutive and easier to execute. 

## Article hightlights the following:
Using the color variation of the theme color can be seen on facebook page, this technique helps predicts the color changes that looks good
It is less subjective

I suppose the author calls it less subjective since all work is done with just one color, i.e. the theme color

In facebook, the search bar is a darker theme of theme color

The article continues with describing a technique of adding color variation to a website, the golden rule here is to use a inverse relationship between saturation and brightness

Lighter Color Variation = lower saturation + higher brightness
Darker color variation = raise saturation + lower brightnes

suming up the above 
Darker color variations are made by lowering brightness and increasing saturation. Brighter color variations are made by increasing brightness and lowering saturation.

The article point to a time tracking tool called 'Harvest', I really liked the light yellow background with a stint of orange shade like the dawn of the morning and looks like a brush stroke in a circle

Article then moves on to explain what is hue?
Even if you hold brightness and saturation constant, and just vary hues, you will get a range of luminosities, or perceived brightnesses, which we measure in values between 0 and 100.

The important bit is this: if you don’t count saturation and brightness, shifting hue towards red (0°), green (120°), or blue (240°) will decrease the luminosity, or perceived lightness of the color. And shifting the hue towards yellow (60°), cyan (180°), or magenta (300°) will increase the perceived lightness of the color.

Now I’ve been pretty brief with all of this. There are still many topics to cover:

How is hue even more important in gradients and data visualization?
When you’re in Sketch (etc.), what technique do you use to make darker variations?
Do you to move saturation or brightness more?
How do you find grays that match your color scheme?
How do you pick totally unrelated colors that look good together?
How do you fix it when colors clash?
And, of course, just why are RGB and CMY the low/high points on the luminosity graph?
I’m glad you asked.
